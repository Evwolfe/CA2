# CA2
Just a simple order/stock/delivery system.    Essentially, we would have 3 tables: 1 for stock (product ID, name, qty, price), 1 for orders (order ID, product ID, delivery ID), and then delivery (delivery ID, name, cost) something like that.   We would have functionality to include inputting new items into the system, adding in stock to the system, adding/removing Delivery services.   We would have a few screens covering basic stuff â€“ a stock screen with a search/ filter functionality (perhaps based on name and or availability), then there would be a screen for your cart to summaries the order. Then there would probably be a payment page with option for cash and card. Final screen would be confirmation of the order placed.
